# Windows Terminal

Windows Terminal has changed!   &nbsp; &nbsp;  Take a look [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/)

Previous one would modify &nbsp; &nbsp; `profiles.json` &nbsp; &nbsp; to tweak Windows Terminal, which was in user profile path:
`copy .\profile.json $HOME\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\`

No need any more.  Start with the configuration has change to &nbsp; &nbsp; `settings.json` .   Secondly I've found it automatically picks of installations!  PS7 preview ... Ubuntu ... Fedora ....  Windows Terminal simply found it and added it.  Quite impressive.
